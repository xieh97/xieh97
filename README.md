## 🎓 About Me

I'm a doctoral researcher at Tampere University, specializing in **machine learning for audio-language understanding and
multimodal modeling**. My passion is building AI systems that can interpret and respond to sound and language in ways
that bring real-world value.

Before entering research, I spent 7+ years as a **software engineer**, where I gained deep experience in scalable system
design and practical problem-solving. Today, I work at the intersection of **ML research and software engineering**,
combining scientific depth with hands-on development to create robust, efficient AI applications.
