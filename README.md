## 🎓 About Me

I'm a doctoral researcher at Tampere University, specializing in **machine learning for audio and multimodal
understanding**. My passion is building AI systems that can interpret and respond to sound and language in ways that
bring real-world value.

Before entering research, I spent 7+ years as a **software engineer**, where I gained deep experience in scalable system
design and practical problem-solving. Today, I work at the intersection of **ML research and software engineering**,
combining scientific depth with hands-on development to create robust, efficient AI applications.

## 🧠 Research Interests

- 🎧 Machine Learning for Audio Understanding (classification, detection, retrieval, generation)
- 🔍 Self-Supervised Representation Learning
- 🔄 Multimodal Learning (audio + text/vision)
- 🧩 Low-Resource Learning (zero-shot, few-shot)

## 🛠️ Skills & Tools

- 💻 **Programming**: Python, Java, Scala, JavaScript, SQL, C/C++, R, Matlab, LaTeX, GDScript
- ⚛️ **Machine Learning**: PyTorch, TensorFlow, scikit-learn, Ray Tune, MLflow, Spark
- 🗣️ **Audio & NLP**: librosa, torchaudio, NLTK
- 📊 **Data Analysis**: NumPy, SciPy, Pandas, Jupyter, Matplotlib
- 🌐 **Web, Backend & Architectures**: Java EE, Spring, Hibernate, Django, Flask, RESTful APIs, Microservices,
  Event-Driven Architectures
- 📱 **GUI & Game Development**: PySide6, Godot Engine
- 🛢️ **Databases & DevOps**: MySQL, PostgreSQL, Linux, Docker, Git
- ⚙️ **Concurrency & Systems**: Multi-threaded Programming, HPC

## 🧪 Featured Projects

- 🔎 [**Multimodal Audio-Text Retrieval System**](https://github.com/xieh97/text-audio-retrieval) – Developing models
  that match audio clips with text queries using multimodal learning.
- 🤖 **X-GoBot** – 🔧[WIP] Developing a voice-enabled desktop AI assistant with local processing and contextual awareness.

## 💬 Let's Connect

I'm always happy to chat about **audio ML**, **applied AI**, or building systems that make sense of sound. Whether
you're hacking on a side project, exploring new ideas, or working in research — feel free to reach out, I'd love to
