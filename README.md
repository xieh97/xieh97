### Hi there :wave:

- :seedling: I'm a PhD student majoring in Signal Processing.
- :book: I'm currently working on audio processing with machine learning methods.
- :bookmark_tabs: My publications
  - :calendar::tada: Our recent work "[On Negative Sampling for Contrastive Audio-Text Retrieval](https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.04070)" has been accepted at ICASSP 2023.
